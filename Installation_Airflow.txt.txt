cd airflow_project

Create a virtual environment:

virtualenv airflow_venv

source airflow_venv/bin/activate

Step 4: Install Apache Airflow with Constraints

Set Airflow constraints:

AIRFLOW_VERSION=2.6.2

PYTHON_VERSION="$(python --version | cut -d " " -f 2 | cut -d "." -f 1-2)"

CONSTRAINT_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-${AIRFLOW_VERSION}/constraints-${PYTHON_VERSION}.txt"

Install Apache Airflow using constraints:

pip install "apache-airflow==${AIRFLOW_VERSION}" --constraint "${CONSTRAINT_URL}"

Step 5: Initialize the Database

Set the Airflow home directory:

export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow

Initialize the database:

airflow db init

Step 6: Start Airflow

Start the web server:

airflow webserver --port 8085

source ~/airflow_project/airflow_venv/bin/activate        source airflow_venv/bin/activate

airflow scheduler

Accessing Airflow

http://localhost:8085

Additional Steps

Set up the Airflow user (Optional):

airflow users create
